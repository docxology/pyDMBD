# Dataset Comparison Report

## Overview
This report compares the characteristics of different datasets used for DMBD testing.

## Datasets Analyzed
- **Forager**: Shape torch.Size([301, 1, 5])
- **Synthetic**: Shape torch.Size([500, 1, 3])
- **Binary**: Shape torch.Size([1000, 1, 3])

## Key Observations
- The statistics show differences in data distributions across datasets
- Binary dataset has the simplest distribution (0/1 values only)
- Synthetic dataset has controlled dependencies between variables
- Forager dataset has more complex dynamics and potentially higher noise

## Implications for DMBD Convergence
- Despite varying complexity levels, all datasets failed to converge
- This suggests fundamental issues with the DMBD update algorithm
- The binary dataset's failure is particularly concerning as it represents the simplest possible case
- Further investigation into the DMBD implementation is recommended
