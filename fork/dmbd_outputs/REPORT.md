# DMBD Model Evaluation Report

## Summary
This report summarizes our efforts to implement and test the Dynamic Markov Blanket Discovery (DMBD) model on various datasets, including the Forager example, synthetic datasets, and a binary dataset. Despite systematic testing and multiple approaches, we encountered persistent challenges in achieving convergence with the DMBD model across all datasets.

## Approach
We adopted a systematic testing approach:

1. **Forager Example**:
   - Implemented error handling and visualization improvements
   - Configured hyperparameters for better convergence
   - Simplified the model and reduced dimensionality
   - Added detailed logging and diagnostics

2. **Synthetic Dataset**:
   - Created a synthetic dataset with a clear Markov blanket structure
   - Generated time series data with known dependencies
   - Visualized data tensor statistics and distributions
   - Tested multiple learning rates and iteration counts

3. **Binary Dataset**:
   - Created a minimal binary dataset with three variables (System, Blanket, Environment)
   - Established clear dependencies between variables
   - Used binary values (0/1) to simplify the learning task
   - Tested with increased iterations and various learning rates

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Performed a comprehensive comparison of all three datasets
   - Analyzed statistical properties including means, standard deviations, and skewness
   - Visualized distributions, autocorrelations, and cross-correlations
   - Identified key differences and similarities between datasets

## Findings

### Forager Example
- The DMBD model consistently failed to converge on the Forager dataset
- Issues included dimension mismatches and errors during the update process
- Data tensor statistics showed a 5-dimensional dataset with varying distributions:
  - Dimensions 1, 2, and 5 had values between 0 and 1 with means around 0.42-0.97
  - Dimensions 3 and 4 had normalized values with means near 0 and standard deviations of ~0.99
- Visualization improvements helped in understanding the data structure

### Synthetic Dataset
- Despite creating a dataset with a clear Markov blanket structure, the model failed to converge
- The synthetic dataset had 3 dimensions with values ranging from -0.61 to 0.69
- All dimensions had means close to 0 and standard deviations around 0.21-0.25
- The distributions were relatively symmetric with skewness values close to 0

### Binary Dataset
- Even with a simplified binary dataset (values of 0 and 1), the DMBD model failed to converge
- The data tensor statistics showed balanced distributions across dimensions:
  - Shape: (1000, 1, 3)
  - Values were strictly 0 or 1
  - Mean values around 0.42-0.47 for each dimension
  - Standard deviations around 0.49
  - Higher skewness values (0.85-0.95) indicating asymmetry in the binary distributions
- Despite the simplicity of the dataset and clear dependencies between variables, all update attempts failed

### Comparative Analysis
- The datasets varied significantly in complexity and statistical properties:
  - Forager: Most complex with 5 dimensions and mixed distributions
  - Synthetic: Moderate complexity with 3 dimensions and continuous values
  - Binary: Simplest with 3 dimensions and binary values
- Cross-correlation analysis revealed different dependency structures:
  - Forager showed complex correlations between dimensions
  - Synthetic had controlled correlations based on the designed dependencies
  - Binary showed clear correlations matching the intended Markov blanket structure
- Autocorrelation analysis indicated varying temporal dependencies across datasets
- Despite these differences, the DMBD model failed to converge on any dataset

## Challenges

1. **Model Complexity**: The DMBD model involves complex mathematical operations and multiple components, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

2. **Optimization Difficulties**: The model appears to struggle with optimization, failing to converge even with simplified datasets and various hyperparameters.

3. **Dimension Mismatches**: In some cases, dimension mismatches occurred during the update process, suggesting potential issues with tensor handling.

4. **Lack of Convergence Diagnostics**: The model provides limited information about why convergence fails, making it challenging to identify specific issues.

5. **Binary Data Limitations**: Even with the simplest possible dataset (binary values), the model failed to learn the dependencies, suggesting fundamental issues with the learning algorithm or implementation.

6. **Dataset Independence**: The failure across datasets with vastly different statistical properties suggests that the convergence issues are not data-dependent but rather inherent to the model or its implementation.

## Recommendations

1. **Further Simplification**: Create even simpler test cases, possibly with only two variables and deterministic relationships.

2. **Algorithm Modification**: Consider modifying the update algorithm to improve convergence properties, possibly by adding regularization or changing optimization methods.

3. **Convergence Diagnostics**: Implement more detailed diagnostics to understand why the model fails to converge, such as tracking loss values and gradient norms during updates.

4. **Alternative Implementations**: Explore alternative implementations or variations of the DMBD model that might have better convergence properties.

5. **Gradual Complexity**: Start with a working minimal example and gradually increase complexity to identify at which point convergence issues arise.

6. **Hyperparameter Search**: Conduct a more comprehensive hyperparameter search, possibly using automated methods like grid search or Bayesian optimization.

7. **Code Review**: Perform a detailed review of the DMBD implementation to identify potential bugs or numerical stability issues.

8. **Mathematical Analysis**: Revisit the mathematical foundations of the DMBD model to ensure the update equations are correctly implemented and numerically stable.

## Visualization Improvements

Throughout our testing, we made significant improvements to the visualization capabilities:

1. **Trajectory Visualization**: Enhanced visualization of agent trajectories and role assignments.

2. **Data Tensor Analysis**: Implemented comprehensive data tensor statistics and visualizations, including distributions, correlations, and time series plots.

3. **Diagnostic Reporting**: Created detailed debug logs and reports to track model behavior and convergence attempts.

4. **Comparative Visualization**: Developed tools for comparing different datasets and understanding their statistical properties.

## Conclusion

While the DMBD model shows promise for discovering Markov blankets in time series data, significant challenges remain in achieving reliable convergence. Our testing across multiple datasets, including a simplified binary dataset, consistently resulted in convergence failures despite various approaches and hyperparameter configurations.

The comparative analysis of the datasets revealed that despite their different statistical properties and complexity levels, the DMBD model failed to converge on any of them. This suggests that the convergence issues are fundamental to the model or its implementation rather than being data-dependent.

Future work should focus on simplifying the model, improving diagnostics, and addressing potential numerical stability issues. The visualization improvements developed during this process provide valuable tools for understanding the data and model behavior, which will be beneficial for future development efforts.
