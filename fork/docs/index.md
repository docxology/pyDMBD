# Dynamic Markov Blanket Detection (DMBD) Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Dynamic Markov Blanket Detection (DMBD) package.

## Overview

DMBD is a method for discovering macroscopic objects from microscopic observables. It uses dynamic Bayesian attention to assign labels to microscopic observables, identifying them as part of a macroscopic object, its boundary, or the environment. The underlying model features a latent dynamical system with Markov blanket structure.
